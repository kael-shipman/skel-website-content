This is the home of Skel's official documentation. I've tried to arrange this in the form of a very short book whose story arc will guide you through the process of learning about Skel and how to use it. Because Skel is just an interface library, though, the entire story is about why the interfaces were designed the way they were and how they work together and communicate. To demonstrate these concepts, the book will of course bring us through the creation of a sample application, for which I'll use my own "official" implementations of the Skel interfaces. These implementations, however, are a footnote, and the real conceptual takeaway is how they relate to each other and how you can create components that relate in the same way.

At the end of the book is the all-important [Appendix A: API Docs](/docs/apx-a-api), which will include API docs for my specific implementations, followed by a less important but still significant [Appendix B: Best Practices](/docs/apx-b-best-practices). Enjoy!
