Skel is a library of standard PHP component interfaces that can be used by developers to build interoperable components and application frameworks. Its primary initial goal was to allow me to build my own custom application framework, but in a way that would allow others to a) easily understand and contribute to my projects, and b) not get locked into my framework. Thus, primarily, it is meant to be a way that developers can agree on how certain components should interact without forcing each other to use specific implementations of those components.

There's actually another project with this very same goal: [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/){target=_blank}, and more specifically FIG's [PHP Standards Recommendations](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/){target=_blank}. While I applaud this development and am excited to someday to contribute to it, I personally wanted a sort of proving ground first. The process of standards development is long and highly bureaucratic. I needed a way to both quickly publish my best shot at some really unexciting interfaces (i.e., stuff that it's unlikely others would really care that much about), and also mash my interface proposals around in real-world use-cases to see if they were the best way forward before suggesting them as standards.

Thus, I conceived Skel as a sort of "beta world" for my own personal proposals to PHP-FIG PSRs, and I'm publishing it in a way that will allow others to use it, add to it, and change it.
